The two .txt files are data dumps from the official website's APIs.
###To run correlations_practice, ensure that the two .txt files are in the same directory as correlations_practice.py.


correlations_practice.py looks at stats whose values are numerical and tests which ones most strongly correlate to a high points per game value.

To-do:
  Compute swing in average ppg for different opponents. I.e. find out how much a player's ppg changes when facing West Ham compared to       Manchester United.
  Use the analysis to predict which players will perform best the following week.
